# Carbide

The Carbide project is a high-performance, priority-based task scheduling and execution framework 
designed for concurrent environments. It enables efficient task management by providing features like 
priority-based scheduling, lock coordination, dynamic re-prioritization, task cancellation, and resource 
optimization. The framework is ideal for systems requiring low-latency, high-throughput task execution, such
as job schedulers, game engines, or dependency management systems.

It will have more features in the future other than a scheduling framework. I use this library mainly for 
Minecraft modding and cybersecurity projects. 

You may contribute to this if you please. I(M4ximumpizza) will continue to contribute to this project.

# Carbide

Carbide is a high-performance, priority-based task scheduling and execution framework
designed for concurrent environments. It enables efficient task management by providing features like  priority-based scheduling, 
lock coordination, dynamic re-prioritization, task cancellation, and resource optimization. The framework is ideal for systems 
requiring low-latency, high-throughput task execution, such as job schedulers, game engines, or dependency management systems.

This is a library I use for Minecraft modding, Minecraft server development and cybersecurity projects. 

You may contribute to this if you please. A future contributor guide will be made.

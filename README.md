# Carbide

The Carbide project will be a collection of projects. It has two major projects inside of it being the scheduler 
x86 disassembler and a java scheduler. 

Rive is the x86/64 disassembler. It does not have very many things inside of it yet as its in very early development. It 
so far has a huge plethora of x86/64 registers. 

Carbide itself is inside the src directory. It is a high-performance, priority-based task scheduling and execution framework
designed for concurrent environments. It enables efficient task management by providing features like  priority-based scheduling, 
lock coordination, dynamic re-prioritization, task cancellation, and resource optimization. The framework is ideal for systems 
requiring low-latency, high-throughput task execution, such as job schedulers, game engines, or dependency management systems.

This is a library I use for Minecraft modding, Minecraft server development and cybersecurity projects. 

You may contribute to this if you please. A future contributor guide will be made.
